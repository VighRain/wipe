# wipe
A simple utility to corrupt and wipe files and directories.  
Corrupts your chosen file by placing #s in random places and then wipes it from the filesystem with no chance of recovering it.  
Can also wipe directories, including all the files nested inside.

Basically an attempt to implement the TDD approach. Hello, MIREA!
